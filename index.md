## Story is everything.  

  

I TEST to [Film School](https://www.biola.edu/film) to learn how to tell them, and started my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/embodiedjosh) so I could share them with others. Not wanting my worlds to be confined to the page, I started teaching myself Digital Art and Design: sharing what I learned as I learned it with the next generation of dreamers.

My passion for stories fed my passion for teaching, as the first led me to learning and deconstructing advanced artistic systems like: 

* Photobashing 

* Principles and Elements of Design

* Iconography 

* Realtime Ray Trace Rendering  

* Voxel Sculpting  

* Polygonal Modeling 

  

and the second led me to grasp communicative systems through which to simplify the complex for beginners:  

* Video Editing 

* Web Development 

* Technical Writing 

* Computer Systems 

* Motion Graphics/Post Production  

  

With over 100 educational tutorials and over 300,000 minutes of watch time, my teaching on YouTube has earned me the privilege of becoming a YouTube partner: giving me the opportunity to see members of my community learn new systems of their own, and make tangible progress in achieving their own ambitions.  

  

Stories expose the "why" beneath the "what" and the "how". All of the skills I've developed on my journey are enhanced with an underlying story. Underlying stories facilitate effective contribution and understanding internally, and ensures optimal brand cohesion and user experience externally.  

  

Underlying stories can be difficult to find, but I'm determined to unearth them and learn any new systems to convey them, in order to enhance and magnify the work being done.
