## Story is everything.  

I specialize in project management, content strategy, video production, writing, and editing. I'm responsible for the outlines, storyboards, transcripts, shooting, video editing, and post production of over 100 educational training videos. 

>Stories expose the "why" beneath the "what" and the "how".  

I like partnering with people to help them tell their stories, get audiences excited about their work, and help that work get done. Nothing makes me happier than finding the right words and techniques needed to simplify and streamline complex information. I think clear, clever, and compelling narratives are the best way to engage an audience and impart understanding, both internally and externally.  

I went to [Film School](https://www.biola.edu/film) to learn how stories worked, and started my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/embodiedjosh) so I could share my story with others. I want to tell stories that change people's lives. I believe the future of storytelling is interactive, and I created my own Process to learn the skills neccesary to tell them through games.  

  
My passion for stories fed my passion for teaching, as the first led me to learning and deconstructing advanced artistic systems like: 

* Photobashing 

* Principles and Elements of Design

* Iconography 

* Realtime Ray Trace Rendering  

* Voxel Sculpting  

* Polygonal Modeling 

  

and the second led me to grasp communicative systems through which to simplify the complex for beginners:  

* Video Editing 

* Web Development 

* Technical Writing 

* Computer Systems 

* Motion Graphics/Post Production  

  

Stories expose the "why" beneath the "what" and the "how". All of the skills I've developed on my journey are enhanced with an underlying story. Underlying stories facilitate effective contribution and understanding internally, and ensures optimal brand cohesion and user experience externally.  

  
The art of communication and storytelling are cut from the same cloth, and are used in our daily lives to help us better understand each other. Underlying stories and optimal communication channels can be difficult to find, but I'm determined to unearth them and learn any new systems to convey them, in order to enhance and magnify the work being done.
