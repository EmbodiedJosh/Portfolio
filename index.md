## Story is everything. 

I went to [Film School](https://www.biola.edu/film) to learn how to tell them, and started my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/embodiedjosh) so I could share them with others. Not wanting my worlds to be confined to the page, I started teaching myself Digital Art and Illustration: sharing what I learned as I learned it with the next generation of dreamers.  

>Stories expose the "why" beneath the "what" and the "how". 

My passion for stories fed my passoin for teaching, as the first led me to learning and deconstructing advanced artistic systems like Photobashing, Realtime Ray Trace Rendering, Voxel Sculpting, and Polygonal Modeling, while the second had me simplify the complex for beginners. 

Stories expose the "why" beneath the "what" and the "how". Technical Writing, Web Development, Computer Systems, Communications, Video Editing- all are skills I developed on my journey and all are enhanced with an underlying story. Underlying stories facilitate effective contribution and understanding internally, and ensures optimal brand cohesion and user experience externally. Underlying stories can be difficult to find, but I'm determined to unearth them to enhance and magnify the work being done.
